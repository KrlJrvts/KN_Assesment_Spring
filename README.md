3. Open the `src.main.resources.application.properties` file and change the database connection properties 
to match your database connection properties
4. Initialize the database by running the `database.reset_database.sql` script in your database
5. Run script `database.create.sql` to create the tables in the database
6. Run script `database.import.sql` to import the data into the database
